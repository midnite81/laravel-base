## get_db_property_id

This gets a property from the database. This is useful when you have, for example, a foreign keyed table and you
want to get a the id of a particular row. 

For example, we might have a logs table which stores a log about something and on that table there is a type_id column. 
So you may want to do a query which searches for particular log type. Rather than hard coding an ID `get_db_property_id`
will return you the id you require. 

_Example Usage_
_In this example we're looking for type 'printed', on the table log_types_

`get_db_property_id('Printed', 'log_types');`

    This would be the same as running SELECT id FROM log_types WHERE name = 'Printed'

Returns (id of row)

You can also specify the name of the column you wish to query should it not be 'name'. Name is the default. 

For example

`get_db_property_id('Printed', 'log_types', 'typeName');`

    This would be the same as running SELECT id FROM log_types WHERE typeName = 'Printed'
