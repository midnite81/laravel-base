Some base functionality for Laravel

Work in progress - proper documentation to follow.

# Installation

This package requires PHP 5.6+, and includes a Laravel 5 Service Provider and Facade.

To install through composer include the package in your `composer.json`.

    "midnite81/laravel-base": "2.0.*"

Run `composer install` or `composer update` to download the dependencies or you can run `composer require midnite81/laravel-base`.

## Refresh Autoloader

At this point some users may need to run the command `composer dump-autoload`. Alternatively, you can run `php artisan optimize`
which should include the dump-autoload command.
